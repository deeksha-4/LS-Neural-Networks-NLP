# Week 1

Before we embark on your journey to make your own GPT clone, we begin by understanding one of the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence - neural networks.

In Week 1, you will understand the logic behind neural networks, and how we harness mathematics and computational power to solve many contemporary problems.

Below you will find links to various online resources to help you with this week's portion. Please go through them. This week's assignment will be added to the repo later. An optional NumPy assignment is also available.

## Python Basics

We'll be using the Python programming language throughout this course. You do not require an in-depth knowledge of the language, but an understanding of the syntax and structure of the language. Refer to the following links to brush up on the concepts.

- [Quick video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) or if you feel like it, you can watch the [complete tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

## NumPy Basics

The NumPy library of Python is an important tool we will use in building our neural networks. Go through the following resources to familiarize yourselves with it.

- [W3 Schools: NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (Recommended)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Python NumPy Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&pp=ygUObnVtcHkgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D) (Video tutorial)

Once you're confident with the theory, attempt the NumPy assignment by completing the tasks assigned in the Colab notebook [NumPy_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/deeksha-4/LS-Neural-Networks-NLP/blob/d01828745564914c97083791380ad87fea217176/Week1/NumPy_Assignment.ipynb) in the Week1 folder. Save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive before you start making changes to it.
_Note: This is an optional assignment_

## Neural Networks

- **Strongly Reccomended:** Finish [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) and complete the video tutorials by the end of this week.

You do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.

- You may also watch [this 4 video infographic series by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) to better understand a lot of the math behind neural networks

## PyTorch

PyTorch is another powerful library we'll be using to implement our neural networks. Again, you do not require an in-depth knowledge of this module, just a basic understanding of the syntax and the specific functions we'll be using.

- [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) for the basic functions you'll need to build the classifier.
