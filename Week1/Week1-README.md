## NumPy Basics

The NumPy library of Python is an important tool we will use in building our neural networks. Go through the following resources to familiarize yourselves with it.
1) [W3 Schools: NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (Recommended)
2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&pp=ygUObnVtcHkgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D (Video tutorial)

Once you're confident with the theory, attempt the NumPy assignment by completing the tasks assigned in the Colab notebook ([Week1/NumPy_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/deeksha-4/LS-Neural-Networks-NLP/blob/d01828745564914c97083791380ad87fea217176/Week1/NumPy_Assignment.ipynb)) in the Week1 folder. Save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive before you start making changes to it.
