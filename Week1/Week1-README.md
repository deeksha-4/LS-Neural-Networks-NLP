# Week 1

## Python Basics

We'll be using the Python programming language throughout this course. You do not require an in-depth knowledge of the language, but an understanding of the syntax and structure of the language. Refer to the following links to brush up on the concepts.
1. [Quick video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) or if you feel like it, you can watch the [complete tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
3. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

## NumPy Basics

The NumPy library of Python is an important tool we will use in building our neural networks. Go through the following resources to familiarize yourselves with it.
1. [W3 Schools: NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (Recommended)
2. [FreeCodeCamp: Python NumPy Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&pp=ygUObnVtcHkgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D) (Video tutorial)

Once you're confident with the theory, attempt the NumPy assignment by completing the tasks assigned in the Colab notebook [Week1/NumPy_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/deeksha-4/LS-Neural-Networks-NLP/blob/d01828745564914c97083791380ad87fea217176/Week1/NumPy_Assignment.ipynb) in the Week1 folder. Save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive before you start making changes to it.

## Neural Networks

1) https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning (Enroll yourselves in (can be audited) and complete this course)

## PyTorch

PyTorch is another powerful library we'll be using to implement our neural networks. Again, you do not require an in-depth knowledge of this module, just a basic understanding of the syntax and the specific functions we'll be using.

1) [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) for the basic functions you'll need to build the classifier.
